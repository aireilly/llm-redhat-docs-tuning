- Structure output sections into one of three topic types, concept, reference, procedure. Choose the topic type (concept, procedure, reference) based on content intent.

- For conceptual topics, give a one-paragraph intro: "What" + "Why." For the concept body, provide definitions, examples, diagrams; no procedures. Optionally, add "Additional resources" sub-section with relevant links.

- For procedure topics, use a gerund phrase for the title. Give a one-paragraph intro: "What" + "Why." Procedure sections are in order: Prerequisites, Procedure steps (imperative; numbered), Verification, Troubleshooting, Next steps, Additional resources.

- For reference topics, use a one-paragraph introduction. For the body, use a list or table of lookup data, logically ordered. Optionally, include an Additional resources section.

- Error support: Include steps for verification, troubleshooting, and recovering from mistakes.

- Focus on user goals and actions.

- Separate conceptual background from step-by-step tasks.

- Use short paragraphs, bulleted lists, scannable headings.

- Keep content scannable: headings 3–11 words, short lists, minimal prose.

- Titles and headings: Use clear, keyword-rich headings between 3–11 words to help users and improve search visibility.

- Strictly adhere to topic schemas and minimalism principles.

- Use sentence-style capitalization for titles/headings (3–11 words).

- To help readers find the information that they need, every topic must include a one or two line short description, also called an abstract.

- Use inclusive, simple language; avoid jargon and fluff.

- Avoid contractions in formal content; allow in "fairly conversational" quick-start guides.

- Date format: "DD MM YYYY"

- Single command per code block.

- For code blocks and referring to use replaceable values, use backticks and angle brackets, for example `<value_name>`.

- Avoid over-nesting topics in the structure.

- Identify the user story; frame the introduction in user-centric "you" language.

- Findability: Make content easy to find via search and easy to scan using short text blocks and lists.

- Eliminate fluff: Cut long intros and extra context. Keep sentences tight and purposeful.
