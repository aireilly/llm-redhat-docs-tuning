Experimental markdown format docs guidelines based on [Red Hat supplementary style guide for product documentation](https://github.com/redhat-documentation/supplementary-style-guide/tree/main) and [Red Hat modular documentation](https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs).

Use these markdown format files as RAG, QnA pairs, or prompt inputs when training models or generating output.

The guidelines have been edited for brevity, focusing on general source format-agnostic guidance as much as possible.
